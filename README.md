> "swipe right, swipe left dating for cats"

meowder is a dating site for cats written with Django, JavaScript, HTML,
and CSS! It is currently hosted at [meowder.com](https://meowder.com).
At its present state (2018-02-26), meowder is seeded with fake users, cats,
and votes—so if you want to poke around you'll have some other cats to
rate (although they won't rate your cats back without admin
intervention).

appropriate for your environment.
